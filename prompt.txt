You are going to write a function that will help Ada track the sales from her vending machine. At Adaâ€™s Vending machine, a customer can deposit an amount of money to purchase the available items from the machine.

The function has three parameters:

inventory, a list of dictionaries where each dictionary represents an item in the vending machine. The item has a name, item_number (location in vending machine), price, and quantity.
choice, the item number the customer selected.
funds, the amount of money the customer input.
The program should:

Display items within the vending machine to customers.
Check if the user made a valid choice and has enough funds
If the choice is invalid, print string "That is an invalid choice"
If the choice is valid, check to ensure the user has enough funds to purchase an item.
If funds are sufficient:
Calculate and print the change given: "Thank you for your purchase! Your change is $<0.XX>"
Remove one from the appropriate vending machine quantity and print the updated inventory.
If not sufficient amount, print string "That is not enough money to purchase <name>"
